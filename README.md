### **What and Why?**

**TripTease** is a collaborative travel planning platform designed to streamline the group travel planning process. Organizing trips with friends, family, or colleagues can become chaotic and stressful, with disagreements and indecision about where to go, what to do, or where to eat. **TripTease** solves this problem by offering a shared space where users can suggest trip ideas and vote on them in real-time. This ensures that decisions are made democratically, reducing friction and making trip planning more enjoyable.

The problem this system addresses is the difficulty of group decision-making when planning trips. Most people have experienced the frustration of endless discussions over destinations or activities in group chats. **TripTease** eliminates this chaos by centralizing the planning process in one place, ensuring that the group can easily see and vote on suggestions.

This system is important because it allows groups to collaborate in a structured way, reducing confusion and preventing disagreements. It makes group trips more enjoyable by giving everyone an equal voice in the planning process.

### **For Whom?**

**TripTease** is built for groups of friends, families, and colleagues who frequently travel together. These real users have likely faced the challenges of group trip planning in the past, and **TripTease** offers them a practical solution to simplify the process.

### **How?**

From an end-user's perspective, **TripTease** will offer the following features:

- **Create a Travel Group**: Users can create a group for a specific trip and invite friends or family to join via a unique link or code.
  
- **Add Recommendations**: Group members can submit suggestions for restaurants, activities, and destinations, which will be categorized for easy browsing (e.g., Food, Activities, Destinations).
  
- **Upvote/Downvote Dynamic Voting System**: Users can continuously upvote activity suggestions, with the most upvoted options rising to the top. This voting system allows the group to easily see and prioritize the most popular ideas, and allows users to change their mind as new activities are suggested/added.
  
- **Add Details**: Users can attach notes, links, or dates to each suggestion, providing additional context for the group.
  
- **Post-Trip Summary (Stretch Goal)**: After the trip, activities actually done can be marked as completed, and the app can generate a fun summary of the activities that the group experienced, similar to a Spotify Wrapped. Users can rate the activities after they are marked as completed, and those ratings can be shown as part of the summary.

### **Scope**

**TripTease** is reasonably scoped for a team of 3-4 programmers to complete within a semester. The project will focus on key features such as group creation, suggestion submission, and the upvoting/downvoting system. These features balance frontend and backend tasks and provide enough complexity to engage the team without overwhelming them. The real-time voting mechanism and user/group management functionalities offer a technical challenge, but are manageable for the group size and timeframe.
